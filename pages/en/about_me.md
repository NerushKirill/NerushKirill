## About me:

I have been immersed in Python development for over 5 years, with a primary focus on data-centric projects. 
My journey commenced with crafting data processing programs tailored for measuring instruments and military complexes, 
igniting my passion for data-driven solutions. For a span of 3 years, 
I served as a data engineer within the measurement laboratory of the Ministry of Defense, 
honing my skills in harnessing data for actionable insights.

Transitioning into the realm of programming within a governmental corporation, 
I specialized in automating infrastructure interactions and ensuring the seamless functionality 
of IT infrastructure components, including servers, databases, and workstations. 
Additionally, I contributed to backend development efforts for the organization's 
corporate portal, enhancing its efficiency and functionality.

Simultaneously, I embarked on freelance endeavors, 
undertaking diverse projects ranging from backend development to crafting parsers and bots.

My tenure as a data scientist at Sberbank's internal audit department further enriched my experience. 
Here, I delved into ad-hoc analytics and spearheaded the development of pipelines to construct 
analytical data marts and facilitate machine learning model training.

Presently, I am engrossed in the construction of data warehouses and the orchestration of ETL/ELT pipelines. 
Fuelled by an insatiable curiosity, I remain dedicated to continuous 
learning and eagerly share my expertise with others.
